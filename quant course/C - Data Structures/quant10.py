# the main problem with linked lists is that :- how to search for arbitrary items faster than O(N) linear running time complexity

"""We can solve this problem by using something known as :- "Hashing" """

 # so in a dict there is a key: value 

 # the hash function will do some mathematical operations to the input or the keyto get an integer 

 # for example there is a = {adam : 13}

 # we have to convert that adam using the hash function

a = 65 # these are the ASCII values of the respective alphabets, ASCII values are standard code for electrical communciation and telecom
# communication. Just a standard structure of communication code...ASCII </p> 
d = 100
a = 97
m = 107

# the integer should be in the range of [0, m]

"""h(Adam) = (65 + 100 + 97 + 107) % m""" # modulo m tells makes sure the hash function is within a given range

# m is the index of the last item, 0 is the index of the first item
