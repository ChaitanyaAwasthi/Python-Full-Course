"""importing modules"""
"""In Python, modules are files that contain Python code, including variable definitions, function definitions, 
and classes.
 Modules allow you to organize your code into separate files, making it easier to manage and reuse."""

#basically using functions, variables and source code from other files and using it again in another 

#for example, you made a file 

# module.py

def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")

pi = 3.14159


# script.py

"""import module #in this you can just use the module file as a module and use it's functions or code already written

module.greet("Alice")
print(module.pi)"""
