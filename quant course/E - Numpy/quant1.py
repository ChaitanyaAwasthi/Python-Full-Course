# NumPy - numerical python 
# we can achieve 50x faster running times with NumPy
# it is implemented in python but most crucial operations are using C and C++


# python is convenient scripting langauge, there are references to actual objects like integers in lists, whereas many items can increase the time complexity by a lot 
# that is why numpy arrays are faster with lower time complexity 
# in python lists it's pointing to objects with different memory locations 
# numpy arrays are stored in continuous block in the memory- items are right next to each other with no pointers
